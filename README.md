# GOV.UK Prototyping Kit

The kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

It's built on the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework, and uses these GOV.UK resources:

- [GOV.UK template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template)
- [GOV.UK front end toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit)
- [GOV.UK elements](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements)

Read the [project principles](docs/principles.md).

## Requirements

#### [Node](http://nodejs.org/)

You may already have it, try:

```
node --version
```

Your version needs to be at least v0.10.0.

If you don't have Node, download it here: [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

## Getting started

Install Node.js (see requirements)

#### Download the prototype kit

[Download the zip file](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit/archive/master.zip)

Unzip the file

#### Install dependencies

Open a command line app (Terminal on OSX) and change to the unzipped directory. Then run:

```
npm install
```

This will install extra code that the prototype kit needs.

#### Run the app

```
node start.js
```

Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

#### Hot reload

Any code changes should update in the browser without you restarting the app.

The app recompiles app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss everytime changes are observed.

This project is built on top of Express, the idea is that it is straightforward to create simple static pages out of the box. However, you're not limited to that - more dynamic sites can be built with more understanding of Express. Here's a good [Express tutorial.](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/introduction-to-express--net-33367)
