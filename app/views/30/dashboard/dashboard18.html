                <p>You need to add 7 years to your record and you have 4 years left to contribute before you reach State Pension age on 1 December 2020.</p>
                <p>You also have 5 years on your record which don't count towards your pension because you didn't contribute enough National Insurance. You can fill some of these years to get the 10 years you need to get any State Pension.</p>
          <p>After State Pension age, 1 December 2020 you no longer pay National Insurance contributions.</p>
