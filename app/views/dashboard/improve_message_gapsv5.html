 <h2 class="heading-medium">View your National Insurance record and make payments</h2>
 <p>You have 3 years on your record that do not count towards your State Pension because you did not contribute enough National Insurance. You can pay voluntary contributions to fill these years.</p>
 <p><strong>The most you can get in 2020 by paying to fill gaps is:<br />£145 a week (£628 a month, £7,450 a year)</strong></p>
 <p>Follow these steps:</p>
 <p><strong>1. Check your record is correct</strong></p>
 <ul class="list-bullet">
 	<li>if you think it&rsquo;s wrong you may be able to correct it</li>
 	<li>if you were unemployed or unable to work you may be entitled to claim National Insurance credits</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Correcting your record or claiming credits may make years count towards your State Pension.</p>
 <p><strong>2. Pay voluntary contributions</strong></p>
 <p>You can see the cost of paying voluntary contributions to make years full, the effect it would have on your pension and make payments.</p>
