      <p>You currently have 3 years on your National Insurance record, using the latest complete tax year, up to 5&nbsp;April&nbsp;2015. You need at least 10 years to get any State Pension.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">It's not possible for you to get any State Pension based on your National Insurance record</h2>
    <p>You need to add 7 years to your record and you only have 3 years left to contribute before you reach State Pension age on 1&nbsp;December&nbsp;2020. After this you no longer pay National Insurance contributions.</p>
    <p>You also have 1 year on your record which does not count towards your State Pension because you did not contribute enough National Insurance.</p>
