<h2 class="heading-medium">View your National Insurance record and make payments</h2>

   <p>You have 3 years on your record that don't count towards your State Pension because you didn't contribute enough National Insurance. You can pay voluntary contributions to fill these years. </p>

 <p><strong> The maximum amount you can get in 2020 by paying to fill gaps is: <br>
       £145 a week (£628 a month, £7,450 a year)</strong></p></div>      
         
<p>Follow these steps:

  <p><strong>1. Check your record is correct</strong></p>

          <ul class="list-bullet"><li>if you think it's wrong you may be able to correct it</li>
  <li> if you were unemployed or unable to work you may be entitled to claim National Insurance credits</li>
 </ul> <p>Correcting your record or claiming credits may make years count towards your State Pension.</p>
          
           <p><strong>2. Pay voluntary contributions</strong></h2>
           <p>You can see the cost of paying voluntary contributions to make years full, the effect it would have on your pension and make payments.</p>
