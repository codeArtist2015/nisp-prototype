    <h2 class="heading-large ">You were contracted out</h2>
    <p>In the past you&rsquo;ve been part of one or more contracted out pension schemes, such as workplace or personal pension schemes.</p>
    <p>When you were contracted out:</p>
    <ul class="list-bullet">
      <li>you and your employers paid lower rate National Insurance contributions; or</li>
      <li>some of your National Insurance contributions were paid into your other pension schemes instead</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">Contracted Out Pension Equivalent (COPE)</h2>
    <p>Your workplace or personal pension scheme should include an amount of pension which will, in most cases, be equal to the additional State Pension you would have been paid. We call this amount your Contracted Out Pension Equivalent (COPE). Your COPE estimate is shown below.</p>
    <p>The COPE amount is paid as part of your other pension schemes, not by the government. The total amount of pension paid by your workplace or personal pension scheme will depend on the scheme and on any investment choices.</p>
    <p>Your COPE estimate is <strong>Â£30.50 a week</strong>.</p>
    <p>The COPE amount is paid as part of your other pension schemes, not by the government.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-medium">When you were contracted out</h2>
    <p>You were part of contracted out pension schemes in these periods.
